# Code3Wich

## Motivation

Initially, I aimed to create a real-time compiler for Unity's web platform. However, I soon realized that Unity's system is too heavy and challenging to run efficiently on a lightweight web environment. Still driven by my original goal of working on game-related projects, I pivoted to focusing on Three.js, a library that can also be used for game development.

While exploring Three.js, I realized that if I wanted to compile and execute JavaScript code, I might as well create a project that supports a complete development environment. Thus, Code3Wich was born!
